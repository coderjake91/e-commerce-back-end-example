## Installation

Clone the repo. Make sure that Node.js is installed locally with npm, navigate to the root directory of the project, and run npm install. Make sure your instance of MySQL server is up an running. From the MYSQL server shell, create the database you will use to test API routes, update connection.js with the apporpriate environment variables (db password, user, and the db itself). Finally run 'npm seed' to seed the db with test data. Test the routes in a program like Insomnia.

## Usage

Run 'npm start' to initialize the Express.js server and the connection to the db through Sequelize.js. Once the database is seeded, test the API endpoints in a program like Insomnia.
